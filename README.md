# Data Analysis Dashboards

This repository contains detailed charts and insights on current and future technology trends, as well as demographic information about the surveyed population.

## Project Overview
These findings were gathered as part of my Capstone Project in the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate Program on Coursera. The goal was to analyze a dataset to uncover insights and present them through visualizations. The dataset includes information on various aspects, such as compensation, work hours, and technology usage across different demographics.

## Contents of the Repository

### PDF Charts

1. **Current Technology Trends**:
    - Analyzes the technologies currently in use across different industries and demographic segments.

2. **Future Technology Trends**:
    - Projects future trends based on current data and industry forecasts.

3. **Demographics**:
    - Provides a detailed demographic breakdown, including age, gender, region, and education level of respondents.

## Conclusion
This project highlights my proficiency in data analysis, visualization, and the use of tools like Python, Pandas, SQLite3, and Tableau. It demonstrates my ability to handle complex data, draw meaningful insights, and present findings in an accessible manner.

Data was provided in CSV file format. Data wrangling was performed using Python with Pandas and SQLite3, and charts and graphs were generated using Tableau.
